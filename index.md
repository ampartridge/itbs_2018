## Welcome to the CUBRIC Introduction to Brain Stimulation Workshop - 5 October 2018

The workshop is focussed on non-invasive human brain stimulation techniques, specifically, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and transcranial electrical stimulation (TES). The instructors  will provide a basic introduction to these versatile methods and how they can be used to investigate the causal links between brain and behaviour in many contexts. The workshop aims to be very practical, including hands-on demonstrations of the methods, and open discussions where you can share ideas and ask any questions you have. The full schedule can be found below.

No previous experience with brain stimulation techniques is required to attend, lunch is provided,  and the workshop is open to Cardiff University postgraduates and staff from PSYCH, MEDIC, BIOSI & HCARE schools.

## Schedule

The final schedule will be available here before the workshop.
